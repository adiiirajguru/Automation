# Python Automation Learning Path

This repository documents my journey of learning Python automation step by step.

## Structure
- `01_python_basics` – core Python concepts for automation
- `02_cli_and_scripts` – running scripts from terminal, arguments, CLI basics
- `03_file_system` – file and folder automation using os and pathlib
- `99_projects` – real-world automation mini-projects

## Learning Log
Day 1-2: 
- Python Automation Foundations
- Set up Python automation project structure in PyCharm
- Created and activated a virtual environment
- Initialized Git repository and connected it to GitHub
- Learned how Python scripts are executed (`__main__` pattern)
- Ran Python scripts from IDE and terminal
- Worked with file paths using `pathlib`
- Read and wrote text files using context managers
- Filtered log files to extract specific entries (ERROR logs)
- Read and processed CSV files using `csv.reader` and `csv.DictReader`
- Practiced condition-based data filtering from CSV files

Day 3: 
- File & Folder Automation
- Inspect folder contents (`pathlib`)  
- Create folders & files programmatically  
- Move files automatically based on file type (`shutil`)  
- Bulk rename files safely  
- Safe pattern-based file deletion
